      If a picture is worth a thousand words, is an emoji the best way to quickly display your emotions?
      why/why not?
      <br>
      <br>
      Many internet memes are absurd or difficult to understand without insider knowledge. What enables them to become
      so popular so quickly, even to those who don't fully understand them?
      <br>
      <br>
      Emojis have a history of having their meaning skewed. Do you think this is a problem of not managing something properly,
      or just another example of a language evolving naturally?

    <h1>Excerpt A</h1>

   <h2>The Social Media Reader:</h2>

<div class="bodyText">
  Now, consider a joke that exists on the Internet. The speed of transmission
is increased yet again, in an incredible way. Space is overcome: computers
connect to one another through far-reaching networks. Time is overcome:
the digitally represented information is available as long as the server
hosting it remains online. A joke stored on a website can be viewed by as
many people that want to view it, as many times as they want to, as quickly as
they can request it.
An online joke’s fidelity of form, however, is subject to a unique contradiction.
Being digital, the joke is perfectly replicable. Copy and paste functions (or their
equivalents) are ubiquitous, expected parts of sofware platforms.6
However, a piece of digital media in the modern landscape of robust and varied manipulation
sofware renders it also perfectly malleable. Individual sections of a piece of
digital media can be lifed, manipulated, and reapplied with little efort.

   <h2>Smiley Lore :-):</h2>
   <div class="bodyText">
       This problem caused some of us to suggest (only half seriously) that maybe it would be a good idea to explicitly mark posts that were not to be taken seriously. After all, when using text-based online communication, we lack the body language or tone-of-voice cues that convey this information when we talk in person or on the phone. Various “joke markers”  were suggested, and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :-) would be an elegant solution – one that could be handled by the ASCII-based computer terminals of the day. So I suggested that. In the same post, I also suggested the use of :-( to indicate that a message was meant to be taken seriously, though that symbol quickly evolved into a marker for displeasure, frustration, or anger.

    <h1>Excerpt C</h1>
    <h2>The inventor of emoji on his famous creations -  and his all time favorite:</h2>
    <div class="bodyText">
      I don’t accept that the use of emoji is a sign that people are losing the ability to communicate with words, or that they have a limited vocabulary. Some people said the same about anime and manga, but those fears were never realised. And it’s not even a generational thing … People of all ages understand that a single emoji can say more about their emotions than text. Emoji have grown because they meet a need among mobile phone users. I accept that it’s difficult to use emoji to express complicated or nuanced feelings, but they are great for getting the general message across.
