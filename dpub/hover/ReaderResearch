is increased yet again, in an incredible way. Space is overcome: computers
connect to one another through far-reaching networks. Time is overcome:
the digitally represented information is available as long as the server
hosting it remains online. A joke stored on a website can be viewed by as
many people that want to view it, as many times as they want to, as quickly as
they can request it.

equivalents) are ubiquitous, expected parts of sofware platforms.6
